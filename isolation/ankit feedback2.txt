goals:
Hi Ankit.
I was pretty close in my estimation of the time I needed for my python tutorials. I ended up learning numpy and pandas a bit. Looked into visualization with matplotlib and pygame. And ended up choosing pyqt as Gui. I had a bit of a problem integrating pygame and pyqt, and spend almost two days figuring why the graphics generated in pygame was not showing in custom QWidget. Finally it turned out that it was a simple matter of laying it out correctly, and setting minimum size of custom QWidget after which it worked as I intended.
On a more practical end I wrote a program that drew chess board in pygames and put queens on it as required by the solution to 8 queen problem. I integrated the graphics into the pyqt interface and added the slider. When you move the slider it shows one of the 92 solutions to the problem on the board.
Now I am finishing the robot navigation problem (should be done in the next couple of hours) and then on to Isolation
So the plan for next week should be making an interface of the isolation game, and implementing the adverserial search. I did not finish watching the project introductory videos, so I might end up adjusting the exact goals to reflect on the requirements. But the idea is to be close to done or done with isolation project in a weeks time.

Issues
Nothing really major. As I mentioned showing the graphics in custom qwidget was a pain. But I figured it out
